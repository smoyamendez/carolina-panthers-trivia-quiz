## Description
---
This repository ("carolina-panthers-trivia-quiz") uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a timed quiz of Carolina Panthers Trivia Questions. 
Users are initially prompted with the instructions for the quiz and a button to start the quiz. Once the user starts, the timer
begins and they are presented with the first question. As they go through the questions and select answers, an indicator flashes
at the bottom to inform them if they are correct or incorrect. If they answer incorrectly, then 10 seconds are subtracted from the 
timer. At the end of the last question, they are presented with their score (the total time remaining on the timer) and an input
field for their name. When they hit 'submit', they are taken to a scores page that pulls all their scores from local storage. They 
are then able to press the try again button to restart the quiz.
